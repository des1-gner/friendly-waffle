When you're using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to a Windows machine, the format you use for the domain depends on the network setup and whether you're connecting to a machine in a domain or a workgroup. Here are the common formats:

For a domain-joined computer:

<test>
domain\username
</test>
or
<test>
username@domain.com
</test>

For a computer in a workgroup or local account:

<test>
.\username
</test>
or just the username by itself.

For a specific computer name:

<test>
computername\username
</test>
The backslash () is more commonly used in Windows environments, especially for older systems. The "@" format (user principal name) is also widely supported and is often used in more modern setups, particularly those integrated with Azure AD.
